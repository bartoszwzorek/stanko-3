                <p>
                  <strong> By making an appointment for permanent make-up you accept the rules so please make sure you
                    have read
                    them in advance. Before our meeting we need to exclude all possible contraindications against the
                    procedure, so please inform me about the current state of your health.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                  One or two days before the appointment you are invited to a 10-minute meeting during which we test
                  sensitivity to pigment and anaesthesia which will be used during the procedure. The purpose of the
                  meeting is to exclude possible allergic reaction to the products used. The date of meeting is set when
                  booking the appointment for permanent make-up. The sensitivity test is obligatory and must be
                  performed 24 h before the planned procedure at the latest. It guarantees the safety and satisfying
                  effects of pigmentation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Directly before the procedure, you should get enough sleep and have a good meal to be rested and full.
                  <strong><i> Proper preparation and good disposition minimise discomfort which may occur during
                    pigmentation.</i></strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Before the procedure it is worth moisturising the skin of the area which will be subject to the
                  procedure and making sure your organism is properly hydrated. Well hydrated skin absorbs pigment well,
                  which is why you should remember to drink water regularly – at least 2 litres per day.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On the day on which the procedure is to be performed you should not take aspirin, which thins blood,
                  or drink coffee or any other drinks which raise blood pressure.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I do not recommend doing permanent make-up while having a period. When the organism is weakened, we
                  are more sensitive to all stimuli and the procedure may seem less comfortable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is inadvisable to do, for example, chemical peelings, microdermabrasion, mesotherapy or other skin
                  irritating procedures for a period of a minimum of one month before the planned date of the permanent
                  make-up procedure. It is also
                  important to refrain from henna or depilation. If the hairs are grown it is easier for me to determine
                  the ideal shape. And the natural colour allows for selecting the right pigment.
                </p>

                <p>
                  About one week before the appointment you should stop tanning the area which will be subject to the
                  procedure.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong><i> <span>If you have had permanent eyebrow make-up done before</span>, please send
                      me the current
                      photograph of your
                      permanent make-up to my e-mail address before booking your appointment.</i></strong> I am not able
                  to correct
                  every
                  permanent make-up. Sometimes the remains of the old make-up are too deeply embedded in the skin. In
                  order to correct this kind of damage you should first have the pigment removed from your skin with a
                  laser. However,
                  if the old make-up is not deeply embedded in the skin, I can cover it up. Please note, however, that
                  such a procedure consists of at least 3 sessions, and pigment correction should be repeated much more
                  often than in the case of pigmentation on clean skin.

                Contraindications</h3>

              <div id="contraindications" class="entry-content">
                <p>
                  Ombre Brows is a technique thanks to which we can obtain the effect of so-called shading. Unlike other
                  pigmentation techniques, it is suitable for each skin type, age and looks. By making use of the right
                  method of pigmentation we can spread the colour in such a way that the make-up will look very natural.
                  With the Ombre Brows technique we can highlight eyebrows with a subtle, medium or intense effect,
                  depending on mutual arrangements.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When choosing a subtle effect – pigment is injected into the skin very shallowly. As a result, the
                  make-up is not intense and less durable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a stronger effect, pigment is placed a bit deeper and more passages are made in a given segment,
                  which makes the make-up more durable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you want the effect to be more intense and long-lasting, have the make-up done more often. I do not
                  recommend deciding on too deep pigmentation to achieve satisfying effects already after the first
                  procedure. It is good to know that too deep pigmentation may result in a greyish tint after healing or
                  an effect of unattractive tattoo. Personally, I am against such practices. I believe that such
                  pigmentation will not highlight but rather exaggerate our looks in an unaesthetic way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each of us has great reserves of beauty. It is sometimes enough to emphasise our good looks in a
                  skilful and subtle way to bring out their natural glamour.

                  <li>
                    Active psoriasis. There is a high risk of development of additional inflammatory foci.

                  <li>
                    Diabetes. Uncompensated diabetes is connected with vulnerability to infections and makes wound
                    healing
                    difficult. There is a problem with blood coagulability. The procedure is carried out after earlier
                    consultation with a doctor.

                  <li>
                    Haemophilia (abnormal blood clotting). It is likely that pigment will spread out in the skin and
                    that
                    the process of healing will be hindered.

                    Cancer during treatment. Chemotherapy may result in worse absorption of the dye in the skin. It is
                    also connected with greater vulnerability to infections. Before the procedure is performed the
                    patient
                    must receive a positive opinion from a doctor.

                    Autoimmunological disease, including thyroid diseases (hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism). Thyroid

                  <li>
                    Use of steroid medicines. They considerably prolong the healing of wounds. After steroids epidermis
                    is
                    thinner and blood vessels are very dilated. If steroid ointment has been used in the place which we
                    want to subject to pigmentation, the client should wait for 6 to 12 months.
                  </li>

                    Antibiotic therapy (min. 2 weeks from coming off the antibiotic)

                  <li>
                    Use of blood thinners (e.g. acard, ibuprofen). Blood thinning medications increase bleeding during
                    the
                    procedure and the risk of pigment rejection.

                    the
                    case in advance. More information can be found in the section “Pre-procedure recommendations”.

                  <li>
                    Tan. To be able to select the right colour of pigment for your eyebrow it is not recommended to
                    sunbathe before the procedure.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Botox injection in the last 4 weeks before the application of permanent make-up
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Chemical or crater peeling in the last 6 months
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Exfoliation procedure performed up to 4 weeks before the application of permanent make-up
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Use of eyebrow revitalisation or stimulation conditioners in the period between 3 and 6 months
                    before
                    the procedure. They are most often based on steroids.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Oily, porous and thick skin (make-up should be repeated more often).
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Use of cleansing herbs such as St John’s wort, marigold, rockrose – it is best to stop using them
                    one
                    month before the procedure.

                <span> Undesirable</span> effects</h3>

              <div id="undesirable" class="entry-content">
                <p>
                  Like in the case of all other invasive treatments performed on the human body, injection of colour
                  pigments into the skin with the use of needles
                  is not risk-free. Therefore, I am not able to predict the client’s individual skin tolerance. Despite
                  testing sensitivity to pigment it is probable that
                  an allergic reaction will occur, even a few years after the procedure.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Due to the possibility of uneven absorption of pigments by the skin, it may happen that in spite of
                  many corrections I am not able to achieve satisfying effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We cannot exclude undesirable colour changes or faster fading of pigment in the skin either.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Undesirable effects may also include possible bruising, reddening, swelling, creation of scars or
                  cocci.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, there are a number of natural reactions of the organism to the performed procedure,
                  including itching in the period of healing, creation of a scab and exfoliation of epidermis in the
                  area covered by the procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to the above-mentioned factors I do not give a guarantee for the durability of pigmentation. What
                  is important is that the decision to have permanent make-up done should be conscious and well thought
                  out.
                </p>

              </div>

              <h3 class="entry-title">
                Duration </h3>

              <div id="duration" class="entry-content">
                <p>
                  The procedure of applying permanent make-up should last approximately 3 hours. Pigmentation is
                  preceded with a consultation so I make individual time arrangements depending on the needs of each
                  client. It is good to have 4 hour of free time.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I always try to make the time spent with me an opportunity for you to relax, rest and mediate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Correction takes a maximum of 2 hours, and make-up renewal in the period of up to 18 months from the
                  first procedure takes between 2
                  and 3 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the procedure is done, I apply subtle make-up avoiding, of course, the eyebrow area. I want you
                  to feel comfortable when leaving my studio and know that you can easily carry on with the day’s tasks
                  and look beautiful.
                </p>
