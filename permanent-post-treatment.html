                <p>
                  Right after the procedure, the area of pigmentation may be irritated, reddened and a bit swollen.
                  These are natural reactions of the organism and we should not be worried about them. Such symptoms
                  will soon subside.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the course of healing of eyebrows the colour of make-up is intense, even in the case of a subtle
                  pigmentation technique. The eyebrows will seem big, broad, dark and exaggerated.
                </p>



                <p>
                  You should not be anxious about it because after the pigmented eyebrows have healed up completely the
                  make-up colour fades by as much as 50% of the initial tone. After the swelling regresses, the eyebrows
                  seem to be thinner by a minimum of 15%.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For 4-7 days the pigment works in the skin and exfoliates, and nearly half of the colour comes out.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The first two days after the procedure are extremely important, so you should perform all activities
                  with great care – be delicate.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The procedural site should be rinsed with lukewarm water twice a day – in the evening and in the
                  morning for a period of 3 days. Remember to wash your eyebrows thoroughly in the evening after the
                  procedure to wash off the excess of plasm and prevent the creation of a bigger scab.
                  You should bathe the place with and against the hair with the use of boiled water and a cotton pad.
                  Make sure to wash your hands before bathing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On the following days your eyebrows may seem very dry and irritated, you can feel uncomfortable
                  tautness of the skin. A delicate scab should form on the surface of the eyebrow, which will gradually,
                  day by day, peel.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On the 4th day after the procedure you should start to moisturise your eyebrows using the Bepanthen
                  cream. Apply a thin layer of the cream.
                  Too much cream may cause the pigment to come out of the skin and, as a result, the pigment will not be
                  absorbed. The activity should be repeated for the following 10 days, twice a day – in the morning and
                  in the evening.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You can use a disposable cotton bud to spread the cream.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Remember to wash off the remaining cream before applying a new layer. For this purpose you can use a
                  small amount of green soap with water and a cotton pad. Then, dry the procedural site carefully with a
                  paper towel and spread a small amount of cream. Be very delicate and do not hurry when applying the
                  cream.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Remember that scabs should come off naturally with the cotton pad during bathing, do not try to get
                  rid of them mechanically. Tearing scabs
                  off on your own initiative may result in a difference in colour or unwanted tone. Give your skin some
                  time, allow for its regeneration and stabilisation of colour. The process of exfoliation may take a
                  few days. Please be patient.
                </p>

                <p>
                  During the process of exfoliation you may observe a difference in colour between the scab and the
                  place where it has already come off. One week after the procedure the pigment may be invisible. You
                  should wait for another 3 weeks to evaluate the colour and shape. At this time the pigment still
                  oxidises and slowly starts to gain colour.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When your eyebrows heal you should not soak, rub or touch the skin in the pigmented area. You should
                  not scratch the scabs, expose the skin to excessive sweating, apply cosmetic products, bathe your
                  eyebrows with patent medicines other than green soap with water, or use other creams than those
                  recommended by the linergist.
                </p>

                <p>
                  During the process of healing it is not recommended to visit a sauna, swimming pool or solarium for a
                  period of 4 weeks after the procedure.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Avoid hot baths, hot tubs and heavy workouts at a gym for a period of 2 weeks after the procedure.
                </p>

                <p>
                  During daily bath avoid soaking the area of your face, especially with warm water. Be careful when
                  washing your hair so that shampoo or other cosmetic product does not come into contact with the
                  procedural site.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is good to change your bedclothes and avoid sleeping on your face in the period of healing of your
                  eyebrows.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you have pets, it is worth avoiding contact with them in the period of healing of the procedural
                  site.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Avoid spicy dishes and alcohol for one day after the procedure.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the course of healing it is recommended to drink plenty of water to hydrate the organism from the
                  inside out.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When healing, your eyebrows should not be exposed to the sun at least for 4 weeks after the procedure.
                  If you decide to have the procedure carried out in summer, you should wear headgear for the
                  above-mentioned period of time. When tanning healed eyebrows, you should always protect
                  the pigmented area with maximum sun filters.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The following procedures should not be performed for a period of 8 weeks after applying permanent
                  make-up: chemical peeling, mesotherapy, hyaluronic acid or botulinum toxin injections.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When your eyebrows have healed up remember to moisturise your skin frequently. Proper care is a key
                  factor which influences the durability
                  of pigmentation. More information on what to avoid and how to take care of your eyebrows can be found
                  in the section “Effects and durability
                  of permanent make-up”.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The final effect is visible after 4 weeks from the last pigmentation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Remember that the process of healing may look different in each client. It depends on the skin type
                  and individual health factors of each of us. If you have any questions, please send me a message. I
                  will try to dispel your doubts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you do not follow the above recommendations, your eyebrows may discolour and the final effect may
                  not be satisfactory.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The effects of permanent make-up <strong>last from 6 to 18 months.</strong>
                </p>


                <p>
                  It is, however, possible that the pigment or its remains will stay in the skin much longer – even for
                  up to 4 years. It is worth knowing that permanent make-up does not disappear from a given area
                  overnight. Pigment is subject to the natural process of exfoliation. It is a process which in some
                  clients proceeds faster and in others more slowly. It depends on individual conditions of each client
                  (skin type, health condition, medicines taken, etc.). In the months following the procedure the
                  pigment becomes less intense. It results, among others, from the fact that eyebrows are located in the
                  T zone, which is an area prone to faster washout of dye from the skin. In order to enjoy the beautiful
                  effects, the procedure should be repeated once a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i> If you like changes and are afraid that permanent make-up will define the look of your eyebrows
                    for good, you couldn’t be more wrong. Thanks to the fact that permanent make-up does not remain in
                    our skin for ever, we can make changes and modify its shape or preferred colour. Personally, I do
                    not like to stick to one pigmentation technique, I get bored quickly. I keep looking for new
                    inspirations and more and more beautiful pigmentation methods. The permanent make-up business is
                    developing fast and there are many new techniques and trends appearing on
                    the market. </i>

              <h3 class="entry-title">
                <span>Durability</span> of make-up</h3>

              <div id="Contraindications" class="entry-content">
                <p>
                  The durability of permanent make-up is always an individual matter. It depends, among others, on the
                  <strong> type of skin. </strong>Mature, greasy, dry, porous or couperose skin is usually more
                  problematic. The process of healing may also differ depending on the skin type. Even with the use of
                  the same technique and the same pigments – durability of pigmentation will be different in every
                  client.
                </p>


                <p>
                  Another very important issue is <strong> health condition.</strong> Our diseases have an influence on
                  our whole body, including our skin. Some ailments or medicines taken weaken the absorption of pigment.
                  The dye may exfoliate unevenly or completely, or even change its colour. This is why it is so
                  important to familiarise oneself with contraindications against the procedure. It is sometimes enough
                  to schedule the procedure for the right time between treatment cycles to increase the chances of
                  problem-free absorption of the pigment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most popular cause of pigment fading is sunbathing. <strong>Sunrays and solarium </strong>have a
                  great impact on the quality of make-up, especially right after its application. Sunbathing dries the
                  skin, speeds up the process of exfoliation and regeneration of epidermis, which in turn results in
                  faster dye exfoliation. UV rays can bring about a reaction under the influence of which the make-up
                  may change its colour. This is why it is so vital to avoid UV rays at least for 4 weeks after the
                  procedure and protect the make-up with creams with filters after it has healed up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Selection of the right pigmentation <strong> technique and method</strong> also has a great effect on
                  the durability of the procedure. When choosing a very subtle effect, pigment is injected into the skin
                  very shallowly. As a result, the make-up may be less intense and durable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The durability of permanent make-up also depends on other factors, including <strong> metabolism, natural skin
                  aging, lifestyle, cigarette smoking, use
                  of certain peeling procedures, henna treatments, use of acid- and Retinol-based cosmetics, individual
                  immunology of the skin, hormones etc.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                 <strong>Skin care</strong> has a significant influence of the durability of the procedure. Remember about sufficient moisturisation of your skin both during and after healing.
                </p>
